CHAPTER 1 - THE EXODUS

As Kishinev burned inside a radioactive mushroom, a surviving group of crewmen on the outskirts of the former capital of the Moldavian SSR 
climbed their self-propelled howitzers. On top of the lead 'Gvozdika', he saw it. The missile. The mushroom. The countless of deaths brought 
by a system he blindly followed. The agony, as his family could've not escaped the strike...

- No more... I've seen enough, he said to himself, as he rose from the roof of the 'Gvozdika' and climbed back into it.

Inside, a rough-looking crew, the men of Molot-1... Men... What a joke. They were barely in their 20s. The driver, Dima... He was 21 years old. 
The gunner, Oleg? 20 years old. The loader, Sergiu? Same... 20... 20 fucking years old.

- So young... robbed of their life... and for what? he asked himself. For the glory of the Party? For the glory of the Soviet Union?

Dima suddenly shouted and stopped the self-propelled howitzer.

- What are you doing you maniac? Oleg yelled, as he tended to his face. The rough stop threw him face-first into the gunner sight 
and now he was sporting a black eye.
- Yeah, what's the hold-up? calmly asked Sergiu.
- A pig just jumped in front of us! Dima gleefully responded as he turned around to the fellow crewmen and pointed. See?

To the crew's surprise, a commissar was outside. And a fat one at that. The commander, tired of this needless stop, opened the cupola and rose. 
To his surprise, it was Mirza, his unit's commissar. He survived the strike. That rat was still alive.

- Where are you going? the fat commissar asked. Who's the commanding officer among you? Who ordered you to move?

As the commander rose above the cupola, Mirza finally recognized him.

- Anatoly? Where are you taking Molot? 

- Just revving up the engines, Mirza. Nothing to worry about, calmly responded Anatoly as he climbed down from his 'Gvozdika'. 

Mirza, sensing that something was fishy, made a step backwards, his hand hovering above his holster. This wasn't the Anatoly that he remembered, 
the loyal and cheerful commander.

- Anatoly, I'm asking you again. What's the meaning of this? Where are you taking Molot?

In a split second, the tired commander pushed Mirza away. His fat bottom hitting the asphalt with a sound of a sack of potatoes. 
The commander slowly took the pistol out of his holster. His trusty Carpati pistol, a gun he received as a gift from another unit 
from Romania during the wargames of the past. He aimed it to Mirza's head. 

- What are you doing? yelled the commissar. Can't you see what has happened? The capitalists finally attacked! We can now start our great 
revolution in Europe! We can liberate the proletariat!

Anatoly, looked back to his howitzer. The crewmen were already on top of it, out of their posts. Behind them, Molot-2 and Molot-3. Same story. 
Crewmen out, and waiting. Watching his every move. His every decision. They waited for him to decide their future. Around them, in the affected buildings, 
civilians finally started to reveal themselves. Tired, scared, without hope... The commander looked back at Mirza, the rat cowering and 
trying to crawl away from him. 

- No more..., he whispered, and without even flinching, emptied the whole magazine into the fat bastard on the spot.

As the execution finally came to an end, there was a collective sigh from the crewmen. 

- Are we finally going to do this? an impatient Oleg yelled. 

The whole group turned towards him.

- What? Don't you give me that look. We all wanted to shoot Mirza. The fat fuck had it coming. 

Anatoly, holstered his pistol, and tured towards the civilians around his unit. 

- Pack whatever belongings you have. Send word to whoever you may find in this mess. Don't go towards the mushroom cloud, you'll get irradiated and 
you'll die very soon and very painfully. We are leaving. All of us. 

One child, holding on to her mother's leg, looked curiously to the commander, and with a squeaky voice, he shyly asked, the question that everyone 
wanted to ask:

- Where are we going? 

The commander, at first didn't answer. And why should he? There wasn't anything left for him here. There wasn't anything left for anyone here. 
There was nothing. But, as he looked towards the West, something deep inside him stirred up. Something that he thought he would never have. 
A flicker of hope. And with a slight smile on his face, he turned towards the child and finally answered: 

- Home... We're going home...

His unit, at first confused then surprised at the prospect of returning to the ancestral lands, quietly started helping the civilians to climb 
on top of their self-propelled howitzers. After 10 minutes, they finally started moving West towards Leuşeni, Anatoly being the last who climbed 
the leading 'Gvozdika' taking a last look at the remnants of Kishinev. 

- We're going home...

As the unit finally got out of the outskirts of the former capital of the Moldavian SSR, one could ask, what happened to this world? What madness 
caused the leaders to fail in maintaining the fragile peace between both sides of the Iron Curtain?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The unit moved slowly on R33, the main artery between Kishinev and Leuşeni. The little group of self-propelled howitzers gradually transformed 
into a convoy of 50 various vehicles, ranging from the little Trabant cars to the PAZ buses to the ZIL trucks, all in all almost 1000 souls, 
held together by this very group of men. Men...

Anatoly scoffed. They were still boys. Even the crewmen from Molot-3. He was much more older than them. But that didn't matter at this point. 
They were scared, and they needed someone to lead them.

Right now, they were stopped in the village of Bujor. The folks here didn't knew about the strike on Kishinev. These poor old farmers didn't 
even had radios. Sergiu tried to convince them to evacuate as soon as possible. But no dice. Stubborn as mules.

Oleg was trying to fill a canister with water from the fountain near the road. He then took a cup from the edge of the fountain, filled it 
with water and tried to give it to the shy child that still held on to his mother's leg. If it weren't for the situation they were in, 
that could've passed as amusing and very cute.

Dima however didn't felt right. Something was coming. He felt it in his bones. Something very dangerous. He looked to his left, towards the 
small hill nearby. He could hear it. The faint sound of helicopters. He looked to his right, towards the commander.

Without a word, Anatoly felt it too. The commanded nodded, and as the driver hurried to the lead 'Gvozdika', he yelled:

- All mount up, we have to move, now! All the civilians back into the cars, back into the buses and trucks! Now!

After what it felt like ages, the convoy started moving again towards Leuşeni. This wasn't good. How could've they find out so fast? 
The radios weren't working. They were fried. At least the civilian ones. The military ones only received static. And the transmission 
tower where the regimental command was stationed? Melted by that blasted nuke.

The next turn they took, they were greeted by a sight they would never forget. Two Mi-24s, flying low and fast, were headed towards 
the crossing point. Their intent, obvious. They were going to destroy the bridge.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Iaroslav Pascal didn't had a good day. It all started with the lack of communications from the regiment. Then the commissar disappeared 
without a trace. That would've not been something bad, had the nuclear alarm kept quiet. But it didn't. It woke up everyone in the village.

Now, he, a disgruntled commander on the single mobile SAM system that was stationed in Leuşeni, the '9K35 Strela-10' he affectionately 
called 'Misha', had to contact whatever higher commander on the battle net he could find. There was only one problem though.

There wasn't anyone on it. Only static. That only made him even angrier. What in the bloody hell was happening? Did the communications 
relay finally gave up from all the Soviet Anthems the army was broadcasting on it? It couldn't be. The engineers from his regiment just 
repaired it a day ago.

And the commissar... That slimy bastard... Where the fuck was he? Did he really just took off without everyone else knowing?

He looked out the window. The only things he could see were his precious 'Misha', the old and rusting Ural munitions truck generously 
donated by the Soviet Army, and a couple of bored and yawning border guards who were just sitting on their arses.

The commander angrily dropped the handset loudly on the table, and stormed out the door, into the barracks yard. As he approached the 
lazy border guards, he could tell that something was off. They were all confused, looking towards North-East.

Then he heard it. A distant sound coming from the hill nearby. The one to the North-East, near Bujor. Something was coming, the sound 
growing louder and lowder. And it was approaching the village very quickly.

As he turned to the guards, out of nowhere, two heavily armoured Mi-24s flew over the barracks yard, passing over the village. He wondered what were they doing here. 
There wasn't an airfield nearby from his knowledge. Then as an answer, they started firing at the bridge.

Iaroslav hit the dirt, the border guards doing the same, shocked.        

- What the fuck are they doing, sir? one of the guards yelled.
- I don't know but we got to stop them! yelled back Iaroslav.

He rose from the dirt, ran and climbed the '9K35 Strela-10' that he affectionately called 'Misha' and shouted towards his crewmen.

- Mount up! We need to stop this madness!
- But sir? We don't have any missiles loaded! both the gunner and loader cried.
- I don't fucking care, we're going in! Bogdan! he yelled towards the still scared borderguard. Take the munitions truck and follow us to the bridge!

The wide-eyed Bogdan looked back towards Iaroslav as if he grew horns on his head. The border guard rose from the dusty ground and tried to pry 
open the truck's door. It wouldn't budge. The bloody door was rusted. As he tried again, he remembered. The commissar had specifically 
told him to not touch the Ural. But why? As he went around it, curiosity peaking, he pulled up the tarp.

- The munitions, Iaroslav! They're not here! a panicked Bogdan shouted.

The commander, on top the already rumbling 'Misha', couldn't believe it. What the fuck happened to the ammunition? Did the commissar take it to another unit?

- What do you mean they're not there? the perplexed commander yelled back.

- They're not here, sir! Not even the medical supplies. It's all gone!

This had to be a joke, someone was pulling a prank on his unit. It had to be a prank. There was no way this was happening to him.

As the prospect of being literally pants-down against the metal birds was being drilled into his head, he sighed.

- If that's the way I'll be going out, so be it, he whispered. Driver! To the crossing! Full speed! shouted a now resigned Iaroslav, as the 
two Hinds were firing on the crossing unopposed, unaware of the now mobile anti-air vehicle moving towards the bridge.
